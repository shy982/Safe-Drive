# Safe-Drive
Driver Drowsiness, Aggressiveness, Distracted-ness detection Software

# Preview
SafeDrive is a software developed to reduce the accidents/mishaps occurring on the road 
due to driver negligence.

Designed to detect multiple events: 
1) Drowsiness 
2) Distractedness
3) Aggressiveness
which are the main factors of driver negligence that lead to accidents.


Currently (March 2020) there does not exist any such software installed in cars in India which detect
and prevent all the above mentioned factors together at a low cost. 

This will be hugely beneficial in India because the cost of installation and inclusion of
such a feature in every car (during production) is very negligible, as the only hardware involved
is a low resolution camera (to detect the driver's facial parameters), a low power microprocessor 
and sensors for acceleration and braking which already exist for most cars. 

Every car manufacturing company can pre-install this software so that it is easily accesible 
to every licensed driver. 

Since there is no relaying of image data to any cloud servers (i.e. the complete system is on-board)
the responses are instant and privacy is also maintained.

Thus with this software, road rage, negligent driving and accidents can be significantly reduced at a 
very small cost (unlike other expensive systems installed in premium cars).It will come in handy for 
preventing potential mishaps and can save many lives.
